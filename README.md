## 🧬 The Project Brief

<strong>This project purpose was to learn the basics of Jest Testing by completing 5 different challenges  </strong>

This is a project to be included by all students at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) as part of the Javascript module.


## 💡 The Project Specific
Having just read about testing in Javascript in this project we learn how to implement our reading in the form of Jest testing.
In this project we all given the objective to create five functions and create five separate test scripts for those functions, these functions include: 
 - Capitalise: Capitalises a string
 - Reverse string: Reverses a string (amazing!) 
 - Calculator: Returns an object with the basic operations add, subtract, multiply, divide
 - [Caesar-cypher](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/): Takes a string and shifts letters up by the given number 
 - Array analysis: Takes an array of numbers and returns an object with average, min, max, and length.

## 🔬 Tools & Technology Used
**Languages & Frameworks**
 - Javascript
 - Jest testing library 26.6.1

**Package Management**
 - NPM

**Linters & Quality Control**
 - [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)

### 💾 Setup & Use

#### Setup

1. Time to ensure you've got Node and NPM installed. If you do, skip this step. Otherwise, head on over to [nodejs's website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download node with npm.

2. Time to go back to the project! Open your terminal (either in your text editor or otherwise) and 'cd' (i.e. navigate) to the root of this repo.

3. Time to install Webpack! Ensuring you're at this repo's root, enter the following command into your terminal. This will install webpack locally (to this project only):
    
        npm install --save-dev webpack

4. Finally, once webpack has installed successfully, run the following command to install all of the projects dependencies:

        npm install

#### Usage
There are a few commands that you can use interact with the project:
 - `$npm run test` - This will indicate jest to find your .test.js files and run the tests.
 - `$npm run jest-watch` - This will dynamically run tests so that any updates (on save) will be retested by Jest automatically.
